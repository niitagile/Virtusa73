Existing System
There was no facility of selecting multiple images at the same time and users were bound to upload single images at a time. Even the size and pixel setting were not provided by the existing system. Users can see the images in the default size and no provision was provided to resize the images while viewing. Rating options and putting watermark for any images, thus users were not able to give any unique identification to a particular image. Scrolling facility was not available for while listing of images and have to check out every images one by one by selecting particular image.
Proposed System
To make a unique album creator some of the exciting features has been added to make it interesting while using this system. Users can see all images by selecting a single image of particular album and scroll down through your mouse to see the next image. Even you can review any image by zooming in and out and rotating the image into 360 direction. The best part of it is creating an html file with the list of images. While selecting this option, a default folder at particular destination will be created with all necessary files which are required to make a file such as its css file, image folder and a single web page.
